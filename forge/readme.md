Browser-Key
-----------

This is a small module for use with browserify that will allow you to generate and store (via localStorage) password encrypted keypairs by prefix. It is essentially a tiny wrapper on the excellent Forge project from digital bazaar.

Usage
-----

On the first run of a given keypair name, it will generate the pair and encrypt the private key using the given password. On subsequent go arounds it will use the given password to decrypt

  var BrowserKey = require("Browser-Key")
  BrowserKey.init("keypairName", "password", function callback(certificatePem, privateKeyPem, publicKeyPem){})


Note
----

The forge.min.js file here is not the same as the one generated by the forge project; it's a shim to be used with browserify without breaking; using this module will export a forge object to the global scope. Unfortunately, I haven't the faintest recollection of how I originally accomplished this (much to my chagrin; undoubtedly this minified file will eventually fall behind the forge trunk). If anyone has experience porting amd modules to CommonJS/browserify and would like to advise, you would be a hero.
